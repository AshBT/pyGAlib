TODO list for GAlib
*******************


HIGH PRIORITY...
================

1. Improve / re-write Floyd-Warshall function. By far the slowest 
function of all.
2. Write a function for the Dijkstra algorithm.
3. I/O support to more graph formats: graphML (.xml), DOT (.dot), etc. 
4. Suggest your own.


WOULD BE NICE...
================

* Finish documentation and use Sphinx for that.
* Check compatibility with scipy.sparse module.
* Include functions for roles of nodes in modular networks.
* Suggest you own.

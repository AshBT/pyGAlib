TODO list for GAlib
===================


High priority...
----------------

#. Improve / re-write Floyd-Warshall function. By far the slowest function of all.
#. Write a function for the Dijkstra algorithm.
#. I/O support to more graph formats: graphML (.xml), DOT (.dot), etc. 
#. Suggest your own.


Would be nice to ...
--------------------

* Finish documentation and use Sphinx for that.
* Check compatibility with scipy.sparse module.
* Include functions for roles of nodes in modular networks.
* Suggest you own.
